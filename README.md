## Joes Github

Welcome to my Github! 
I'm a final year student in Trinity College Dublin courrently completing Masters in Computer Engineering.

My pinned repos down below show some of the academic coursework I've completed during my the last few years in Trinity and during my Erasmus exchange in KU Leuven, Belgium.
From the Trinity projects you'll see a distiributed [peer to peer communication network](https://github.com/jmulvany127/P2PCommsAndDatabase), a [racing game](https://github.com/jmulvany127/CoolRacer) and a [search engine](https://github.com/jmulvany127/Lucene_Search_Engine) implementation. From KU Leuven there is a cloud based [train booking system](https://github.com/jmulvany127/Train_Booking_Cloud_App), an [image classifer](https://github.com/jmulvany127/ImageClassifer_SemanticSegmentation) and [facial recognition system](https://github.com/jmulvany127/Facial_Recognition), a [Capture the Flag](https://github.com/jmulvany127/CTF-Report) hacking project and a control and monitoring system for an [RC buggy](https://github.com/jmulvany127/RC_Buggy_Stack).
